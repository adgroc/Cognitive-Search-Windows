## Overview
The Cognitive Services Search API is a suite of services that offers APIs for autosuggestion, image search, new search, video search, and web search.

The solution contains the SDK and a sample application that allows you to enter your API key and text to perform the following actions:
- Autosuggest
- Image search
- News search
- Video search
- Web search

## The Client Library
The client library is a thin C\# client wrapper for Microsoft Text Analytics API. The easiest way to use this client library is to get microsoft.projectoxford.search package from [nuget](http://nuget.org).

Please go to the [Search API Package in Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProjectOxford.Search/) for more details.
